About:      This script allows you to take a URL and shorten or lengthen it using 
            Google's URL Shortener API.  There is an option to copy the response URL
            to your clipboard by using the '-c' option.  This is a quick and dirty 
            script that I wrote for a specific purpose, but if it helps you out, feel
            free to take it, use it, and modify it.

Options:    -h      help
            -c      copy response to clipboard (OS X)
            -l      lengthen a shortened URL
            -s      shorten a regular URL
            -u      url (required)
